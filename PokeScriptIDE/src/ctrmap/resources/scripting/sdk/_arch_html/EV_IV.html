<h2>Generation IV Virtual Machine</h2>
Pokémon Diamond and Pearl's rudimentary scripting engine, heavily inspired by the previous Game Boy Advance games, laid the foundation for the scripting formats of all the Nintendo DS Pokémon games to come.
The virtual machine itself is heavily limited by the lack of an accessible stack and a miniscule number of variable space and as such is not usable with PokéScript without custom code.
